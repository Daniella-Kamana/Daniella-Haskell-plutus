# 🌍 Global Cardano Developer Onboarding for Universities

Welcome to the official repository for the **Cardano Global University Onboarding Project**, funded by **Project Catalyst** and supported by the **Cardano community**. This initiative aims to empower students worldwide with top-tier **Web3** and **Cardano Smart Contract** development skills.

---

## 🧭 Introduction

We are onboarding **16+ universities globally** under an officially funded **Project Catalyst** program. This is a unique opportunity for your institution to be a **pioneer in decentralized innovation** and actively contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.

**Cardano** is home to **Project Catalyst**, the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine, solving real-world challenges through **community-driven Web3 projects**.
